# GRU Documentation
## About GRU Graphics
GRU is a secure and unique way of storing image data. It uses the .gru file extension, making it more special. GRU Graphics Panel allows you to convert .PNG or .JPG files to .GRU files. GRU is currently unsupported on other image preview applications, so we have developed an option in the Panel to preview .gru images. This application runs on Python, giving the user to modify it. (More details in the ToS)
## Installation
To install GRU on your computer, you must be required to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Please follow [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) to install Python from their official website. After you have installed Python, you may proceed to install GRU. You may download it from the [GRU homepage](https://grugraphics.vercel.app/). 
## Usage
Before running GRU, you are required to set a username and password in the "config" folder. Then, you may proceed to run "encrypt.py" by running this command in the terminal. This encrypts your username and password into a Base64 format for privacy and security reasons.

``
python3 encrypt.py
``

Then, you may run the "main.py" file that allows you to start using the GRU Graphics Panel.

``
python3 main.py
``

Enter your credentials into the program as instructed. After, you may start using the GRU Graphics Panel.
